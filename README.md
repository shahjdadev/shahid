# Shahid Tatkal – IRCTC Tatkal Ticket Booking Assistant (Chrome Extension)

📌 **Hosted on GitHub Pages** – Requesting `shahid.js.org` subdomain via [JS.ORG](https://js.org)

## ✨ What is Shahid Tatkal?

**Shahid Tatkal** is a lightweight, JavaScript-based Chrome Extension designed to automate and speed up the IRCTC Tatkal ticket booking process. Built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – without any backend – this tool runs entirely in the browser and is optimized for both desktop and mobile usage (Kiwi browser support).

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 Secure local form autofill (no external database/API)
- ⚡ Super-fast form prefill and auto-submit
- 📅 Date/time selectors and quota options
- 🤖 Captcha input assistant (manual entry with optimized focus)
- 📲 Mobile-friendly via Kiwi Browser
- 💼 Plan-based subscription system (with local expiry validation)
- 🧾 Payment integration (UPI, QR Code) with auto-restriction after expiry

## 🌐 Project Type

This is a **fully static JavaScript project**, containing:

- Static HTML pages
- Client-side JavaScript files
- Chrome Extension `manifest.json`
- Assets like icons, styles, QR images, etc.

✅ **No backend, no server-side code.**

## 🧩 Why a JS.ORG Subdomain?

As the project is:

- 100% JavaScript-based
- Hosted on GitHub Pages (`https://shahidadev.github.io/shahid`)
- Intended for open-source and public utility
- A Chrome Extension frontend with full JS logic

## 🛠 Tech Stack
